- translate js to ts
- ensure that important helpers can be run locally
- compile list of Math methods with simple signature: # in and # out.
- steps in algo, which'll call parseFn (described below):
  - parameters:
    - "fnStr": string that represents the function
    - "varArr": array of n strings, each representing a variable
    - "startArr": n-element array that contains start values for minimization
  - return:
    - minimum value
    - number of iterations required to reach that value
    - error message?
  - parseFn:
    - parameters:
      - "fnStr" and "varArr": See above.
      - "xArr": n-element array of floats
    - return: value (and error message?)
    - algo
      - In fnStr, replace each var with a paren-enclosed #.
      - Copy-pasta implementation of complex-calculator, and simplify as follows:
        - Ignore units
        - Ignore non-real possibilities
